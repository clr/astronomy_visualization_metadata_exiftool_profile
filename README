DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file allows you to write AVM tags in XMP format to a file using the Perl
package Exiftool.  The AVM standard currently supported is version 1.1.



BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is at least one open bug whereby subsequent writes to the XMP data 
will lose all of 
the tags that contain a period in their name.  See this forum for feedback:
