DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file allows you to write AVM tags in XMP format to a file using the Perl
package Exiftool.  The AVM standard currently supported is version 1.1.



EXAMPLE USAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install ExifTool, put the ".ExifTool_config in your user directory and 
then you can read all of an image's xmp tags with:
exiftool -b -xmp filename
And you can write tags too (on one line):
exiftool -xmp-avm:Distance="far"
  -xmp-avm:Subject.Category+="first" 
  -xmp-avm:Subject.Category+="second" 
  -xmp-iptcCore:CreatorContactInfoCiUrlWork="http://someplace" 
  filename



BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is at least one open bug whereby subsequent writes to the XMP data 
will lose all of the tags that contain a period in their name.  See this 
forum for feedback:
